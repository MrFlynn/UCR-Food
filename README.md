Creates and stores objects based on dining hall menus at UC Riverside.

This project is a bit of a pet project of mine that. It has no real purpose
other than for me to work on something.

## Install:
Project isn't functional... yet. But deps. can be installed:
`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
or
`$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
